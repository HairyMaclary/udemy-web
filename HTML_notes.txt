HTML

HTML is a mark up language and not a programming language.

<!DOCTYPE html> is not actually an element but an instruction to the browser as to what type of HTML to use; here it's v5.

Each HTML document has a head and a body. The head can include the title, CSS styles, info for search engines, and more. All the visible items are in the body.

Attributes provide additional information about an element. For example image tags often include source and alternative text attributes:

    <img src="./author.jpg" alt="Jackson Gonzalez" />

To make a link open in another tab use the target attribute:

    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Link to udemy</a>


If you don't yet have your link address then use href="#". Also, to jsut go to the home page use href="/".
